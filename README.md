# Mental Health Care
A mental health care website where users can perform a quick diagnose of their mental health issues based on a Q&A form. Users can also learn about nearby therapists and book an appointment. Additionally, created a dedicated section providing resources such as videos and guidance for temporary or immediate self-care solutions. Implemented a secure login system for therapists, granting them access to patient information and appointment schedules.
